# Swallows a missing `bd`, an uninitialized database (exit 3), a timeout
# (124), and a rejected timeout interval (125). Every other non-zero status
# still fails the hook — unlike bd-dolt-push.sh, which never does — because a
# beads hook that errors mid-write has touched the database and silently
# continuing would leave it inconsistent.
#
# Honors BEADS_HOOK_TIMEOUT (default 300s) via `timeout`, or `gtimeout` as
# Homebrew coreutils installs it. Default macOS has neither, and there the
# hook runs unbounded — bd-dolt-push.sh carries a portable watchdog for that
# case because it is the one that reaches the network.
#
# Usage: bd-hook.sh <event> [args...]
